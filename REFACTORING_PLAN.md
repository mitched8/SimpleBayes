# Refactoring Plan for SimpleBayes

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Created modular structure with `utils` and `scenarios` packages
2. ✅ Moved common functionality to `utils/bayes_utils.py`
3. ✅ Refactored Medical Test scenario
4. ✅ Refactored Weather Prediction scenario
5. ✅ Added Time Series Analysis feature
6. ✅ Updated app.py to use the modular structure
7. ✅ Updated README.md and requirements.txt
8. ✅ Fixed Streamlit pages issue by renaming 'pages' directory to 'scenarios'

## Pending Tasks

1. Refactor Custom Example scenario
   - Move code to `scenarios/custom_example.py`
   - Implement a `render_custom_example()` function
   - Update imports in app.py

2. Refactor Real World Data Analysis scenario
   - Move code to `scenarios/real_world_data.py`
   - Implement a `render_real_world_data()` function
   - Update imports in app.py

3. Refactor A/B Testing Calculator scenario
   - Move code to `scenarios/ab_testing.py`
   - Implement a `render_ab_testing()` function
   - Update imports in app.py

4. Additional Enhancements
   - Add type hints throughout the codebase
   - Add docstrings to all functions
   - Add unit tests for utility functions
   - Create CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## How to Refactor Each Scenario

For each scenario, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the `scenarios` directory with an appropriate name
2. Implement a `render_X()` function that contains all the UI code
3. Move any scenario-specific helper functions to the same file
4. Use utility functions from `utils/bayes_utils.py` where appropriate
5. Update app.py to import and use the new module

## Possible Future Features

1. Bayesian Network Visualization
   - Interactive tool to build and visualize Bayesian networks
   - Update beliefs in real-time as evidence is added

2. Bayesian Decision Theory
   - Calculate expected utilities using Bayesian inference
   - Demonstrate optimal decision-making under uncertainty

3. Hierarchical Bayesian Models
   - Extend A/B testing to handle multiple segments or groups
   - Visualize the hierarchical structure and parameter sharing

4. Bayesian Reinforcement Learning
   - Interactive demo of Thompson sampling
   - Multi-armed bandit problem with Bayesian updates
